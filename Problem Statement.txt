Train Reservation System

You are designing and implementing a system to enable users to book train tickets through an online portal. In other words, you are working for IRCTC to implement the train reservation system. 

In this round, you will have to build the system incrementally as explained below. For simplicity and considering the time constraints, some of these requirements are simplified. 

Book tickets for a given route, class/coach type and number of passengers.
 
Example:
You will be given a list of trains and coach configurations in below format.
2
17726 Rajkot-0 Mumbai-750
17226 S1-72 S2-72 B1-72 A1-48 H1-24
37392 Ahmedabad-0 Surat-300
37392 S1-15 S2-20 S3-50 B1-36 B2-48

Your program should book the tickets, if there is a train for a given route and if the required number of seats are available in the selected class.

Output: 100000001 4500
